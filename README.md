Notes:
------
First game I've ever built.  I wrote it in Python using pygame.

I used Pixen to develop the graphics.  I had intended to animate the
character, and the png file has animations.  However, I didn't find the
proper pygame documentation in time.

Basic controls:
---------------
* Left:  'a' or 'left arrow'
* Right:  'd' or 'right arrow'
* Up:  'w' or 'up arrow'
* Down: 's' or 'down arrow'
* Turn Left:  'q'
* Turn Right:  'e'

Future ideas:
-------------
*  Add boots: for temporary speed power up
*  Add dome of destruction: which causes zombies to die as they hit the dome
*  Add C-4:  allows player to plant a C-4 explosive device which blows up zombies
*  Add noise maker:  distracts and attracts zombies
*  Add brains:  Provides a secondary target for zombies
*  Add caltrops:  slows down zombies over a period of time
